# Analyzing-Animal-Images-with-Pre-Trained-Networks

This project successfully utilized a pre-trained image classifier to identify various dog breeds from a dataset of images. By leveraging the power of a neural network, the task involved classifying the images and comparing the predictions against known breed labels. Key tasks included developing custom functions, handling command line arguments, and assessing code runtime. Additionally, a dictionary of lists was created to organize and manage data efficiently. The project provided a valuable practical application of Python coding skills and deep learning techniques.
